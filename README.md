MVP
Two pages:
• Home Page
o Carousel of featured products
o Grid of products
• Product Page (with id parameter) - like a product page on another site, allows 
you to add to a cart and select product variants
All products should be stored in Firestore. You should hold the following information:
• quantity
• variants (could be colours, sizes, etc.)
• price per unit
• name
• image URL
• favourited or not (Boolean)
All data should be stored in Firestore and fetched by the front-end. There should be NO 
static product data in the react application.
Make sure your site is scoped to one category of products
Bonus
Using Firestore and react, create a cart system. Create a cart page in your react app.
Add logic to prevent users from adding items to the cart that are no longer in stock. You 
will have to check the current cart and the product quantity Cart page should have the 
following:
• List of products in the cart
• ability to change the number of products in the cart
• ability to remove items from the cart













# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
